# freqtrade-gym

This project is base on [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade)  

The project is in very early stage, so there are a lot of inconvenient part that you have to set up manually. I am working on the improvements.   

## Installation 
### 1. freqtrade
Follow the [freqtrade documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/) to install freqtrade

### 2. Pandas
```sh
pip install pandas
```

### 3. OpenAI Gym
```sh
pip install gym
```

## Example Usage
The usage example is deep_rl.py and the config for freqtrade and freqtrade-gym is config_rl.json and use IndicatorforRL.py as feature extraction.  
This demo is using [openai baseline library](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) to train reinforcement learning agents.  
Baseline can install by  
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev
pip install stable-baselines[mpi]
```

Initialize the user_directory  
```sh
freqtrade create-userdir --userdir user_data/
```  

Download historical data  
(Remember to download a little bit more data than the timerange in config file just in case.)  
```sh
freqtrade download-data -c <config file> --days <Int> -t {1m,3m,5m...}
```  

Move the IndicatorforRL.py into user_data/strategies (you should have user_data/strategies/IndicatorforRL.py)  

Run the demo to train an agent.
```sh
python deep_rl.py
```  

You can use tensorboard to monior the training process  
logdir is defined in deep_rl.py when initializing the rl model
```sh
tensorboard --logdir <logdir>
```  
This will look like

## Example of Loading model backtesting for or trading  

Move the LoadRLModel.py into user_data/strategies (you should have user_data/strategies/LoadRLModel.py)  

Modified the class intial load model part to your model type and path.  

Modified the populate_indicators and rl_model_redict method for your gym settings.  

Run the backtesting  
```sh  
feqtrade backtesting -c config_rl.json -s LoadRLModel
```  

Dry-run trading (remove --dry-run for real deal!)  
```sh  
freqtrade trade --dry-run -c config_rl.json -s LoadRLModelgProto
```


## TODO  
- [x] Update the strategy for loadinf the trained model for backtesting and real trading.
- [ ] The features name and total feature number(freqtradegym.py line 89) have to manually match in the indicator strategy and in freqtradegym. I would like to come up with a way to set up features in config file.  
- [ ] RLlib example.
- [ ] NEAT example.
